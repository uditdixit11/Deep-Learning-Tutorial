Pooling is performed in Neural network to reduce variance and computation complexity.

Pooling layer is used to reduce the dimension of feature maps.

The three types of pooling are:
a) Max Pooling - The maximum pixel value of the batch is selected
b) Min Poolng - The minimum pixel valies of the batch is selected
c) Mean Pooling - The average or mean value of the all the pixels in the batch is selected

Max Poolisng is useful when the background of the image is dark.
Ex - In MNIST dataset the digits are represented in white color and background in black.

Average or Min Pooling is useful when background of the image is white.
Average pooling method smooths out the image and hence the sharp features may not be identified 
when this pooling method is used.

1*1 is used for dimensionality reduction

2*2 and 4*4 are not preferred because odd-size filters symmetrically divide the previous layer
pixel around the output pixel. If this symmetry is not present there will be distortions across
the layer

3*3 is an optimal choice.

Alexnet uses large filter 5*5 and 11*11

The value of kernel filter are learned automatically by CNN through training process.
Kernel size smaller and deeper are better
